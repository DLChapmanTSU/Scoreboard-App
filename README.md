Using this project to experiment with WPF and non-game applications

The goal is to make an application that will log scores for a competitive game of some kind. The current score and the names of the players/teams should be pushed to a text file that can be read by streaming software such as OBS.

If this goes well, I'd also like the ability to save these scores so that tournament organisers can easily keep a log of player stats such as winrates and matchups.
I don't intend to link this to challonge or start.gg as this project is my first attempt at making an non-game program, so I want to keep things simple. This means that the program will need to allow for manual data entry in case an organiser wishes to add results from previous events.

Further stretch goals would include an option to generate "power rankings" based on previous saved results by using an ELO system of some kind.

Any features added will write to text documents to allow broadcasters to add them to their stream overlays in whatever way they please.
